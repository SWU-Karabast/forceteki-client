/**
 * Discriminated union of all event record types. `t` is the discriminant.
 *
 * Two members carry fields that are easy to misread:
 *
 * - `DEPLOY_LEADER.kind` + `target` are set together when the leader deployed AS A PILOT: the
 *   deploy attaches it to `target` as an upgrade instead of placing a body in the arena.
 * - `TAKE_CONTROL`: `p` took control of `card`. A control change is not a zone change, so no
 *   MOVE accompanies it and the fold re-seats the card itself. `zone` is where the card is
 *   now — `ground`/`space` (re-seat a unit), `resource` (shift one resource; `exhausted` says
 *   which bucket) or `base` (a Credit or Force token changed hands); `from` is the seat it
 *   left, present only when this record (and not a MOVE beside it) has to carry the counts.
 * - `EXHAUST_RESOURCES` / `READY_RESOURCES`: resources are counted, never named. `amount` ready
 *   resources of `p` became exhausted (a cost paid, an ability, a resource that entered the row
 *   exhausted), or `amount` exhausted ones became ready (the regroup step readies each one; some
 *   abilities ready several). A reader clamps to what it has.
 * - `CAPTURE`: `p` captured `card` with `by` (a unit id, or `base@N` for a base captor). `p` is
 *   the captor's controller — the seat that holds the card from now on. `RESCUE`: `card`
 *   returned to play under `p`, its owner; the paired `MOVE` out of `capture` places it.
