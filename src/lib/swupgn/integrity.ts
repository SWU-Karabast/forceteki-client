/**
 * Fields that the keyframe gate verifies, per seat.
 *
 * GATED (reconstructable from the event model, single source of truth = the event stream):
 * `initiativeTaken`; per seat `baseHp`, `handSize`, `deckSize`, `resourcesReady`,
 * `resourcesExhausted`, `credits`, `hasForce`, the leader's `id`/`deployed`/`exhausted`/
 * `epicActionUsed`; `hand` (as a set — a hand is unordered) and `discard` (in order — the pile
 * is); and per in-play card matched by id: `zone`, `damage`, `exhausted`, `shields`,
 * `experience`, `statusTokens`, `upgrades` and `captured` (both as sets — attachment order is
 * not part of the model), `power`, `hp` and `keywords` (the live values `STATS` records carry).
 * `baseHp` and `deckSize` are exempt at the first keyframe only — see checkKeyframes. Fields an
 * older file's keyframe lacks (`deckSize`, `leader`, `power`, `hp`, `keywords`,
 * `initiativeTaken`) are skipped: absent is "not recorded", not "zero".
 *
 * `hand`/`discard` CONTENTS were previously ungated, on the belief that only the counts were
 * reconstructable. They are not: every MOVE names its card, so both lists are exact. The fold
 * used to grow `hand[]` from DRAW and never remove, and to leave `discard` to DEFEAT — which
 * fires AFTER the MOVE that already emptied `cards`, so no defeated unit ever reached the pile.
 * Both are now MOVE-driven and gated here; the five vectors produced 45 mismatches before the
 * fix and none after.
 *
 * The keyframe's `cards` array only contains ground/space arena cards (see
 * SwuPgnGameAdapter.buildSwuPgnPlayerState), so card-level checks are scoped to arena cards
 * by construction.
 *
 * NOTE on handSize/resources: the fold reconstructs these from MOVE events (the engine's
 * source of truth for zone transitions; see fold.applyMoveCounts) plus EXHAUST_RESOURCES /
 * READY_RESOURCES for the ready/exhausted split, so they ARE gated here. They are only
 * unreconstructable when a producer removes a card from a zone WITHOUT emitting a MOVE —
 * which in practice happens only under the integration test harness's double-setup
 * (GameStateBuilder), not in a production game. See SwuPgnKeyframeCompleteness.spec.ts.
